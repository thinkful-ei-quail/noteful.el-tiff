Assignment
In this assignment you will build upon the Noteful application that you started in the previous lesson. 
You will add two forms for POSTing new folders and new Notes to the server. 
You will also add error boundaries at appropriate places in the structure. 
Finally you will refactor the components to use PropTypes to validate the props.

Requirements
1)Create a new component AddFolder that implements a form to capture the name of a new folder from the user.
This form should submit the name of the new folder to the POST /folders endpoint on the server.
Ensure that any errors are properly handled. Add a button to the navigation to invoke the new form.

2)Create a new component AddNote that implements a form to capture the name, content and folder for a new Note.
Submit to the POST /notes endpoint on the server. Add validation to ensure that the name of the note is not left blank.
The folder should be selected from a list of existing folders. Ensure that errors are properly handled.
Add a button to the note list page to invoke this new form.

3)Define an error boundary component. Add this component to specific points in your component structure.

4)Review each of the components that you have built so far for this project.
Any component that receives props from its parent should be refactored to define PropType validation.
